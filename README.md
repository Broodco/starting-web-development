# Starting-Web-Development

## What is this repository about?

During the second week of my formation *@BeCode Brussels*, we were asked to recreate a web page about **Tim-Berners-Lee**, following a precise template.
This repository contains my attempt at this exercise.

## Getting Started

## Files and Directories

The repo contains the following directories and files :

 * root :
> index.html : the html code of the webpage.
 * scss : 
> style.scss : main stylesheet of the page ; 
 * css : 
> style.css : stylesheet compiled from scss/style.scss . The one used by browsers.

> style.css.map : map created with the scss -> css compilation.

> styletim.css : old css stylesheet, replaced by style.scss/style.css . Still there for reviewing purpose.
 * resources : 
> jpeg files : images imbedded in the web page.
